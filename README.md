This project implements DMX Receiver for Artemis SBS. Arduino must have an FTDI UART. Uno and other newer boards that have USB UARTs will not work. DMXcommands.xml is used to map "events" in Artemis SBS. The 
forums at the Artemis SBS site are the best resource for more information about Artemis SBS DMX controls. 
I've included the DMXSerial library I used for this project.

I have a YouTube video of this project at
